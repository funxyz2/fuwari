# About

**Hi, I’m Thông!**

>- I’m a second-year student at UIT-VNU, currently diving deep into web exploitation as I work my way into the cybersecurity field. I’m on a journey to break into the field, constantly learning, experimenting, and seeking like-minded people to grow with.
>
>- Beyond the world of security, I find joy in music and philosophy. I play guitar, explore music theory, and often lose myself in deep conversations about life’s meaning, its beauty, and its chaos. Books on philosophy, music, and even quantum computing keep me up at night. I also hit the gym, watch anime, and game whenever I get the chance..
>
>- At the end of the day, I’m just a curious soul who finds joy in exploring the complexities of life—its beauty, its chaos, and everything in between. I may not be an expert in anything, but I’m always open to meaningful conversations about the wonders and horrors of existence.
